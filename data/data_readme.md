*data folder* has two files:-
1. raw_data :- It contains all the data files as downloaded from net.
2. proc_data :- It contains all the data in form of
 		        Date|O|H|L|C|V where all O, H, L, C, V are the normalized values of open, high, low, close of respective companies.

Currently I am using datas of:-
1. APPLE from 1 Jan 2001 to 1 Feb 2019 (USA)
2. HDFC BANK 27 Apr 2005 to 26 May 2017 (INDIA)
3. ICICI BANK 27 Apr 2005 to 26 May 2017 (INDIA)
4. JET AIRWAYS 14 Mar 2005 to 31 Jan 2017 (INDIA)
5. NIFTY 50 27 Apr 2005 to 26 May 2017 (INDIA)
6. RELIANCE 27 Apr 2005 to 26 May 2017 (INDIA)
7. TATA MOTORS 27 Apr 2005 to 26 May 2017 (INDIA)


_Particulary 2017 to 2019 has been rough year for prediction due to several sudden Govt's action like Demonetisation, GST etc., so, I would be involving data till 2016 Nov for finalizing models in INDIAN context_
